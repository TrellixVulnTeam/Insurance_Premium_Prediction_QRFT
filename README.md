Objective : To predict the insurance premium by multiple regression machine learning models &amp; deploy it on heroku

Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health 
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our 
study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an 
insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

Result: We have to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the 
personal for health insurance
